# Bellybutton Diversity Dashboard
---
## Overview
Roza is a biology researcher who works in a microbiology laboratory. Rozaâ€™s role is to identify and record bacteria species that may have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Further, Roza hypothesizes that these bacteria can be found in some human bellybuttons. Thereby, she has decided to take samples of different people's navels. Every participant in the study will have their identity hidden because it is confidential. However, the sample data contains info that substitutes as an ID. 

All participants will have access to a digital and customizable dashboard that enables them to select their specfic participant ID from a dropdown menu. Based on the selected ID #, the dashboard will automatically generate two custom charts displaying the top 10 most frequent bacteria found in their navel and one gauge chart. 

If Roza's hypothesis is correct, Roza will be able to contact whoever possesses this bacteria in their naval and discuss any potential next steps with them.
